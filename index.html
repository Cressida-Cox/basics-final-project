      <strong>Snow Leopards</strong> are part of the <em>Panthera</em> genus,
      related to other big cat species; lion, tiger, jaguar and leopard.
      However, unlike these four species, snow leopards are unable to purr! They
      are native to the mountain ranges of Central and South Asia with the most
      common range for them to be found on is the Himalayas. Their thick
      white-gray coat spotted with large black rosettes allows them to blend in
      perfectly with their natural habitat thus making them one of the world's
      most elusive cats. Sadly, they still face the risk of extinction due to
      being fewer than 7,000 adult snow leopards left in the wild.

      <strong>The expansion</strong> of human settlement, especially livestock
      grazing, has led to increaed conflict. To protect their herds and
      livelihoods, herders sometimes kill snow leopards in retribution. This may
      account for more than half of all snow leopard killings.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>Their lives</strong> are also threatened by poaching, driven by
      illegal trades in pelts and in body parts used for traditional Chinese
      medicine. Between 2008 and 2016 alone, one snow leopard has reportedly
      been killed and traded every day - 220 to 450 cats per year. The true
      extent of the propblem is thought to have even bigger with at least 20% of
      their population lost in two decades as a result.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>Vanishing habitat</strong> and the decline of the cat's large
      mammal prey - wild sheep and goat - are also contributing factors. Climate
      change is raising the average temperature across the snow leopard's home
      range, which scientists believe will shrink the species' alpine habitat
      and drive competion with other predators like leopards, wild dogs, and
      tigers. For these reasons, the International Union for Conservation of
      Nature classifies snow leopards as vulnerable to extinction.
